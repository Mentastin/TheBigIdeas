not wrong (einstein). Arguments based on general thermodynamic arguments are very strong. Maximises disorder.

\chapter{Purview and postulates}
Few relevant degrees of freedom (of the $10^{23}$):
\begin{itemize}
\item Slow on atomistic time scale $10^{-15}$s
\item Coarse on atomistic length scale: only to within $10^9$ atoms
\end{itemize}
Only those few that are essentially time independent are macroscopically observable. (Although up to $10^{-7}$s). Thermodynamics limiting case.
