\section{The derivative}
\subsection{Slope of a curve}
\[ \text{slope of the normal} = \frac{-1}{\text{slope of the tangent}} \]

\subsection{Properties of the derivative}
Here we give some properties of the derivative:
\begin{itemize}
\item The derivative is a linear operation:
\[ (f+g)'(x) = f'(x) + g'(x) \]
and
\[ (c\cdot f)'(x) = c\cdot f'(x) \qquad \forall c \in \R \]
\item \ueig{Product rule}
\[ (f\cdot g)'(x) = f(x)\cdot g'(x) + f'(x)g(x) \]
\item The derivative of $\frac{1}{f(x)}$, assuming $f(x) \neq 0$:
\[ \left(\frac{1}{f(x)}\right)' = \frac{f'(x)}{f(x)^2}. \]
\item Combining the previous two properties, we get the quotient rule (assuming $g(x)\neq 0$)
\[ \left(\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\right)' = \frac{g(x)f'(x) - f(x)g'(x)}{g(x)^2}. \]
\item Finally we have the very important \ueig{chain rule}. This tells us how to take the derivative of composite functions:
\[ (f \circ g)'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x). \]
We can also write this as
\[ \od{f(g(x))}{x} = \od{f}{g}\od{g}{x}. \]
TODO example
\item Derivative of an inverse
\[ \od{f^{-1}(x)}{x} = \frac{1}{f'(f^{-1}(x))} \]
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Derivatives of some common functions}
Using the results below together with the properties above we can calculate the derivative of a large number of functions.

\begin{itemize}
\item Let $n$ be an integer larger than or equal to $1$ and let $f(x) = x^n$. Then
\[ f'(x) = n x^{n-1}. \]
Using this result together with the property of linearity, we can easily calculate the derivative of any polynomial function. TODO: general exponent
\item The derivatives of the trigonometric functions can be derived from
\[ \sin'(x) = \cos \qquad \text{and} \qquad \cos'(x) = -\sin(x) \]
TODO: list
\item TODO cyclometric
\item TODO hyperbolic
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{The exponential and logarithm}
Define natural logarithm $\ln$ and \textit{the} exponential function $\exp$.
\[ \od{\ln x}{x} = \frac{1}{x} \]
\[ a^x = e^{x\ln a} \qquad (a>0, x\in \R) \]

\[ e^x = \lim_{n\to \infty}\left(1+\frac{x}{n}\right)^n \]
and growth.

\subsection{Applications of differentiation}
\subsubsection{Extreme values}

\subsubsection{Rolle's lemma}
\subsubsection{Mean-value theorem}
\subsubsection{L'Hôpital's rules}


\subsection{Higher order derivatives}
When we take the derivative of a function, we we get a new function. We can now take the derivative of this new function. This is called taking the second order derivative. This process can be repeated for as long as the derivatives exist. We write the $n$-th order derivative as
\[ f^{(n)}(x) = \od[n]{f}{n}. \]
So for example $f''(x) = f^{(2)}(x)$.

\section{Dirac delta}
\subsection{In one dimension}
\subsection{In three dimensions}
\subsection{Properties}

\begin{eigenschap}
Composition of the Dirac $\delta$ with a smooth, continuously differentiable function $g$ follows from the following relation
\[ \int_\R \delta(g(x))f(g(x))|g'(x)|\div{x} = \int_{g(\R)} \delta(u)f(u)\div{u} \]
Thus we say that
\[ \delta(g(x)) = \sum_i \frac{\delta(x-x_i)}{|g'(x_i)|}\]
Where $x_i$ are the simple roots of $g$.
