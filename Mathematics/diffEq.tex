\subsubsection{Picard-Lindelöf theorem}
\begin{theorem}[Picard-Lindelöf]
Consider $f: \R\times \R^d \to \R^d$ and the differential problem of finding $y:\R\to \R^d$ such that
\[ y' = f(t,y) \qquad y(t_0) = y_0 \qquad (t_0\in \R, y_0\in\R^d). \]
Let $R$ be the rectangle $[t_0,t_0+a]\times B(y_0, b)$ for some $a,b\in \R$.
If $f$ is continuous on $R$  and uniformly Lipschitz continuous w.r.t. $y$, then the differential problem has a unique solution $y(t)$ on $[t_0,t_0+\alpha]$, where $\alpha = \min(a,b/M)$ and $M$ is a bound for $|f(t,y)|$ on the rectangle $R$.
\end{theorem}
Any norm on $\R^d$ can be used to define $B(y_0, b)$, as they are all equivalent.
\begin{proof}
For any potential solution $y(t)$, the function $t\mapsto f(t,y(t))$ is integrable (TODO ref). So the solution must satisfy \[ y(t) = y_0 + \int_{t_0}^tf(s, y(s))\diff{s}. \]
We use this the construct a sequence of approximate solutions. Set $y_0: t\mapsto y_0$ and
\[ y_{n+1}: [t_0, t_0+a] \to \R^d: t\mapsto y_0 + \int_{t_0}^t f(s,y_n(s))\diff{s}. \]
These integrals can be taken because the graph of each $y_n$ lies in the rectangle $R$:
\[ |y_n(t) - y_0| \leq \int_{t_0}^t|f(s,y_{n-1}(s)|\diff{s} \leq M\alpha \leq b. \]

\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Peano' existence theorem}
\begin{theorem}[Peano' existence theorem]
Consider $f: \R\times \R^d \to \R^d$ and the differential problem of finding $y:\R\to \R^d$ such that
\[ y' = f(t,y) \qquad y(t_0) = y_0 \qquad (t_0\in \R, y_0\in\R^d). \]
Let $R$ be the rectangle $[t_0,t_0+a]\times B(y_0, b)$ for some $a,b\in \R$.

If $f$ is continuous on $R$ and $|f(t,y)|$ is bounded on $R$ with bound $M$, then the differential problem has at least one solution $y(t)$ on $[t_0,t_0+\alpha]$.
\end{theorem}
Any norm on $\R^d$ can be used to define $B(y_0, b)$, as they are all equivalent.
